   <h1 style="color:tomato;">Puzzle Rules and Regulations</h1>
   <h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li> You are given a grid of numbers.</li>
<li>Your goal is to connect all the numbers in the correct order to form a single continuous path.</li>
<li> The path must cover every cell exactly once.</li>
<li> Moves can only be made horizontally or vertically (no diagonals).</li>
<li>You can’t revisit a cell once it’s been used.</li>
<li> The puzzle is solved when all numbers are connected in the correct sequence.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Regulations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start with unique numbers or numbers pairs that stand out.</li>
<li>Look for corner or edge constraints — they often limit moves.</li>
<li>Test possible paths but avoid ones that get “trapped” early.</li>
<li>Use the undo/reset option if you get stuck.</li>
</ul>
